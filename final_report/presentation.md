## Roadmap

- Basic concepts
- Opportunities & challenges
- General procedure
- Scheduling
- Communication
- On-device training

<!-- slide -->
## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial machineries that resembles human intelligence,
either in terms of their functionality or behavior.

<!-- slide -->
## Machine Learning (ML)

The study of intelligent agents that
can adapt to previously unseen situations based on historical data.

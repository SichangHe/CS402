\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

TODO: Briefly introduce your understanding of AI,
provide an overview of the application of the AI in your research area.
For example, you can discuss the current development trend and
provide a roadmap of the development of AI techniques in your research area.

\section{TODO: Main Body}

TensorFlow Federated \cite{bonawitz2019towards} is oriented to
provide infrastructure for simulation for production-level FL on smartphones.
TODO: read again.

FedML \cite{he2020fedml} is a FL as a Service (FLaaS).
It uses MNN for its training on Android,
and it has not provided an iOS SDK.

Flower \cite{beutel2020flower,mathur2021ondevice}
only provides a communication layer and
leaves the training implementation to the users.
For the training implementation,
its Android example depends on TensorFlow Lite and
its iOS example depends on Core ML.

Syft \cite{ryffel2018generic,Ziller2021,hall2021syft}
proposes a custom training process and
offers implementations for both Android and iOS,
but it is low-performance and only uses CPU.

PaddlePaddle \cite{ma2019paddlepaddle} by Baidu is
also mainly for simulations oriented to production.
It supports inference on Android.

FATE \cite{liu2021fate} is mainly for production-level simulations.
TODO: read again.

OpenFL \cite{patrick2022openfl} is also mainly for simulations.
TODO: read again.

FedScale \cite{lai2022fedscale} leans towards benchmarking.
It supports Android via a UNIX environment.

Project Florida \cite{madrigal2023project}
is a production-ready FLaaS by Microsoft.
Its Android training is marketed as accelerated,
and its iOS training is not mentioned.

% or you can conduct the comparative study by
% testing some state-of-the-art methods on your selected dataset.)

\section{Discussion}

TODO: Provide an outlook on the development of AI technology in
your research area based on your knowledge of your research area and
your understanding of AI.
You can discuss some open challenges and try to
provide the corresponding potential solutions or
discuss the potential research directions.

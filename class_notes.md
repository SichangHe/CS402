most supervised learning when ppl talk about

## ethics

- Mill's utilitarianism:
    maximize benefit for everyone, mostly equally

    bane:
    - conflict of interest
    - personal benefit
- Kant's formalism/ duty ethics:
    unconditional command for every individual

    bane: universal principle may harm specific people
- Locke's Right Ethics:
    individual has right simply by existence

    bane: what to do when two people's rights conflict
- Aristotle's virtue ethics:
    objective goodness from human qualities

    bane: how to find the "golden mean"

the golden rule (all above agrees with)

> Do unto others as you would have others do unto you

### codes of ethics

statements of general principles, followed by instructions for specific conduct

defiens duties the professional owes to
society/employers/clients/colleagues/subordinates/profession/self

### engineering design process

1. recognize problem/need, gather information
1. define problem/goal
1. generate/propose solution/method
1. evaluate benefit&cost of alternatives

### handling ethical issues

1. correct the problem
1. whistle blowing
1. resign in protest

## definition of artificial intelligence

- humanly → acting
- ration → math/theory

### Turing test

- NLP
- knowledge representation
- automated reasoning
- ML

#### total Turing test

perceptional abilities

- computer vision
- robotics

### thinking humanly

- get inside the working of human mind
- general problem solver
- cognitive science

### thinking rationally

- correctness
- logic
- fact-check

### knowledge-based system

- general-purpose search
- domain-specific knowledge
- knowledge bottleneck

## intelligent agent

### rational agent

1. prior knowledge of environment
1. performable action
1. performance measurement
1. perception

### task environment

PEAS: performance measurement, environment, actuators, sensors

properties

1. fully/partially observable
1. single/multiple agent
1. deterministic/stochastic
1. episodic/sequential
1. static/dynamic
1. known/unknown

### agent structure

- function: perception → action
- architecture: sensory → actuator

#### table-driven structure


$$
n_{entry}=\sum_{t=1}^T|P|^T
$$

- simplest
- e.g. industrial robot
- #cases explode

#### simple reflex agent

match input against rule, return action

- model-based: only work for fully observable
- goal-based
- utility-based: maximize gain expectation

## search

- breadth/depth first

## example application

### collaborative perception

- share raw data → huge overhead
- extract feature
- share object position

### anomaly detection

- bidirectional optimization
